# rmtodo
Simple world-readable webapp for tracking individual tasks.

## About
This is a task manager I made for myself at work.  It is globally readable, meaning anyone can see what is on my plate, but only my user can log in and add tasks.  I intend to add features and such as I need them, but found it to be a better alternative than all of the other too-integrated todo apps via like GSuite and such which were too easy to ignore.

## Building
```
$ podman build -t quay.io/robbmanes/rmtodo:latest .
```
